## About our Guy

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "images/ID_deadsea.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

Hey there, my name is Andrew Kines. I am a TV and film editor as well as an DIT/DMT in IATSE 667 in the Toronto area. Apart from the creative work of storytelling I also take great pleasure in helping people come to grips with the technology of video and audio storytelling.  

### Intent is Important

  <p>
I am messing about with generating a static website and also learning markdown at the same time. Because, hey, why the hell not. This is one of those fun functions of markdown that they always mention on the evangelist pages. "Hey look you can indent for code" or somesuch thing.
I dont know that I'll ever really need to use this (Code? what code?) But I've put this here because I think it's fun to give stuff a try.

Well that was fun. Hope you learned something.
